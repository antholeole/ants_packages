A bunch of packages that I use when I develop. My little building blocks :).

In general, to use these packages, you should point to them in your `pubspec.yaml`.

Some of these are also on pub.dev, like `local_value`! Heed to this warning: any of these 
packages may experience breaking changes whenever I feel like it. If you're going to depend on these, 
please point to a specific commit so you don't have to deal with the headache that is breaking changes.
